# CalorieCalculator
This is an application that has been built using Swift 5.0 & storyboard for demosntrating Reactive programming in Swift using combine.

This is an application that calculates the amount of calories burned after doing a specific exercise for specific amount of time.This can be calculated using a formula,
Total Calories Burned = (Duration of Exercise * MET * 3.5 * Weight of the person) / 200, 
where MET is the Metabolic Equivalent of a Task (MET) - measures how many times more energy an activity burns in comparison to sitting still for the same period of time.
